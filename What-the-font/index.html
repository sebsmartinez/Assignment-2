    <h2>Olivia Rodrigo</h2>

        <div class="verse">
            <p>Cat got my tongue</p>
            <p>And I don't think I get along with anyone</p>
            <p>Blood running cold</p>
            <p>I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke</p>
            <p>And I hate all my clothes</p>
            <p>Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones</p>
            <p>So, I guess I should go</p>
            <p>The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know, I know, I know</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <p>I broke a glass, I tripped and fell</p>
            <p>I told secrets I shouldn't tell</p>
            <p>I stumbled over all my words</p>
            <p>I made it weird, I made it worse</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Chorus -->
        <div class="verse">
            <p>Each time I step outside</p>
            <p>It's social suicide</p>
            <p>It's social suicide</p>
            <p>Wanna curl up and die</p>
            <p>It's social suicide</p>
            <p>Ah, ah, ah</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 3 -->
        <div class="chorus">
            <p>I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (uh-huh)</p>
            <p>Searching "How to start a conversation?" on a website (how to flirt?)</p>
            <p>I talked to this hot guy, swore I was his type</p>
            <p>Guess that he was making out with boys, like, the whole night (oh)</p>
            <p>Everything I do is tragic (oh)</p>
            <p>Every guy I like is gay</p>
            <p>The morning after, I panic (oh)</p>
            <p>Oh, God, what did I say? (Oh, whoa, yeah)</p>

            <p>Wanna curl up and die</p>
            <p>It's social suicide</p>
            <p>Yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine</p>
            <p>But don't let me out at night</p>
            <p>It's social suicide</p>
            <p>It's social suicide</p>
            <p>Ah, ah, ah</p>

        <div class="bridge">
            <p>Each day that I'm alive</p>
            <p>It's social suicide</p>
